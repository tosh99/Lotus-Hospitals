        <p>The legacy of Lotus Hospitals is that of Dr. V.S.V. Prasad and one that precedes Lotus Hospitals itself.
            Having studied medicine and completed his residency in All India Institute of Medical Sciences (A.I.I.M.S) in 1991,
            Dr. Prasad further specialised in the US and UK to acquire his Fellowship in Pediatric Critical Care & Neonatology.</p>
